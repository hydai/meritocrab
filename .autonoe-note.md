## Task Completed
DOC-001: Create GitHub Actions mode setup guide and update project documentation

## Accomplishments

Successfully created comprehensive documentation for GitHub Actions mode deployment. All 7 acceptance criteria met and verified.

### Acceptance Criteria Verified

1. **Created docs/github-actions-setup.md**: ✓ Complete step-by-step setup guide with 7 main sections
2. **Guide is accurate and complete**: ✓ Covers workflow file copying, secret configuration, and state initialization
3. **LLM API key setup explained**: ✓ Detailed instructions in "Step 2: Configure LLM API Key" section
4. **State branch initialization**: ✓ Two methods provided (CLI and manual) in "Step 3" section
5. **.meritocrab.toml customization**: ✓ Explained in "Configuration" and "Customization" sections
6. **README.md updated**: ✓ Added "Deployment Options" section with comparison table and links
7. **Troubleshooting section**: ✓ Covers all required issues plus additional scenarios

### Implementation Details

**File created**: `docs/github-actions-setup.md` (697 lines)

**Documentation structure**:
- **Quick Start**: < 5 minute setup with 4 steps
- **Detailed Setup**: 5-step walkthrough (workflow files, LLM key, state branch, config, enable)
- **Configuration**: Repository-wide settings and workflow permissions
- **Testing the Setup**: 3 verification tests (PR, credit check, state branch)
- **Customization**: Scoring adjustments and LLM model selection
- **Troubleshooting**: 7 common issues with causes and solutions
  - Workflow not triggering (4 causes)
  - Artifact not found (3 causes)
  - LLM API key not set/invalid (4 causes)
  - State branch conflicts (retry logic explanation)
  - Workflow runs slow/times out (3 causes)
  - Evaluation comment not posted (3 causes)
- **Migration to Server Mode**: Export/import process and hybrid mode notes
- **Rate Limits and Costs**: GitHub Actions minutes and LLM API pricing

**README.md updates**:
- Added "Deployment Options" section before "Installation"
- Server Mode vs GitHub Actions Mode comparison
- Comparison table with 11 criteria
- Links to both setup guides
- Migration path explanation

**Key features of the guide**:
- Security-focused: Explains secret management and workflow isolation
- Practical: Includes curl commands for downloading workflow files
- Comprehensive: Covers both quick start and detailed setup paths
- Reference from DESIGN-github-actions.md comparison table (Section 8)
- Includes rate limit information from DESIGN Section 7
- Migration path notes for Actions → Server mode transition

### Pre-commit Verification

All pre-commit checks passed:
- ✓ `cargo fmt --all` — No formatting changes needed
- ✓ `cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings` — No warnings
- ✓ `cargo test --all` — All 192 tests passing
- ✓ `lineguard docs/github-actions-setup.md` — Formatting verified
- ✓ `lineguard README.md` — Formatting verified

### Testing Summary

**Documentation quality checks**:
- ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria verified against implementation
- ✓ Cross-referenced with DESIGN-github-actions.md for accuracy
- ✓ Verified workflow file references (pr-evaluate.yml, pr-gate.yml, pr-commands.yml)
- ✓ Verified CLI commands (`meritocrab-cli state init`, `credit check`, etc.)
- ✓ Verified secret name (`MERITOCRAB_LLM_API_KEY`)
- ✓ Verified branch name (`meritocrab-data`)
- ✓ Verified configuration file (`.meritocrab.toml`)
- ✓ All troubleshooting scenarios covered with solutions

**Verification method**: Manual review of documentation against acceptance criteria and existing workflow implementations

## Issues Found and Fixed

None. Implementation proceeded cleanly with no regressions. All existing tests continue to pass.

## Project Status

- All tests passing: 192 unit/integration tests + 5 doctests
- No clippy warnings (passed with -D warnings)
- No formatting issues (cargo fmt --all)
- Working tree clean except for this notes file
- Documentation complete and ready for users

## Commit Information

Commit: f7bf19b
Message: docs: add GitHub Actions mode setup guide and deployment comparison

**Files changed**:
- `docs/github-actions-setup.md` (new, 697 lines)
- `README.md` (updated, added Deployment Options section)

## Next Steps

Task DOC-001 is complete. The GitHub Actions mode setup guide is production-ready and provides:
- Complete setup instructions for zero-infrastructure deployment
- Comprehensive troubleshooting for common issues
- Migration path to server mode if needed
- Cost and rate limit analysis

All workflow implementation tasks (WF-001, WF-002, WF-003) and CLI tasks (CLI-001, CLI-002, CLI-003) are complete. The GitHub Actions mode is fully documented and ready for adoption.

## Documentation Coverage

The new documentation complements existing guides:
- **DESIGN-github-actions.md** — Technical design and architecture
- **docs/github-actions-setup.md** — End-user setup guide (NEW)
- **SETUP.md** — Server mode setup guide
- **README.md** — Overview and feature comparison (UPDATED)

Users now have a clear choice between deployment modes with complete setup instructions for both.
